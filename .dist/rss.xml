          <description xml:base="https://ziap.github.io/blog/polymorphism/">&lt;p&gt;When I first heard about run-time polymorphism in C++ using virtual methods, my
first thoughts were like, “This is cool and all, but why would I ever use
this?” Then I continued to ignore it because I could always just work around it
instead of using it. Until recently, my college lecturer told me that using
virtual methods is great for designing and maintaining applications with
thousands of objects. I figured that I should write about what run-time
polymorphism is, and why I still think that I don’t need it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          <description xml:base="https://ziap.github.io/blog/new-website/">&lt;p&gt;I already have a website hosted on GitHub pages. It was built around 2 years
ago as a way to quickly browse and access my web projects. Basically, it was
just a grid of project thumbnails, which is pretty boring. During the last 2
years, I changed bits and pieces of it, but it’s still the same boring layout
with only a list of projects and some basic information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
