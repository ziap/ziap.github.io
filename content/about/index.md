Iâ€™m Zap, a student and software developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
At school, I research machine learning algorithms and applications. During my
free time, I usually work on side projects or learn new techniques. My goal is
to create helpful tools and applications with intuitive and presentable
interfaces.

I'm glad you've came across my website. This is where I organize and share my
thoughts and experiences. I'll try to write about my notes or opinion about
certain topics I recently encountered, especially those that I found
interesting or had the most trouble articulating.

## Tech stack

C is my weapon of choice, as I can have a comprehensive understanding of most,
if not all, of the language. I even use C for performance-critical parts of my
web apps by compiling them into [WebAssembly](//webassembly.org/). Other
languages that I frequently use are Rust, JavaScript, Python, and Lua, but I
can work with a wide range of languages and tools.

For personal projects, I prefer making things from scratch for educational
purposes. But for work, I used many frameworks, and my personal favorites are
[Svelte](//svelte.dev/) for front-ends and [Starlette](//www.starlette.io/) for
back-ends. This website is built with [Zola](//www.getzola.org) because of its
ease of setup, incredible speed, and flexible template engine.
