Iâ€™m Zap, a student and software developer based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
At school, I research machine learning algorithms and applications. During my
free time, I usually work on side projects or learning new techniques. My goal
is to create helpful tools and applications with intuitive and presentable
interfaces.

I'm glad you've came across my website. This is where I organize and share my
thoughts and experiences. I'll try to write about my notes or opinion about
certain topics I recently encountered, especially those that I found
interesting or had the most trouble articulating.
