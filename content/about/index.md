I’m Zap, a student and software developer based in Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam. At school, I research machine learning algorithms and
applications. During my free time, I usually work on side projects or learning
new techniques. I work on a wide range of topics in computer science, and my
goal is to create helpful tools and applications with intuitive and presentable
interfaces. Most of my work involves front-end development, computer graphics,
and computer vision.

I'm glad you've came across my website. This is where I organize and share my
thoughts and experiences. I'll try to write about my notes or opinion about
certain topics I recently encountered, especially those that I found
interesting or had the most trouble articulating.
